# Introduction #
  This project was made focusing in how the number of enrollments in disciplines affect the overall performance of students from UFRN. We are using information about 4 semesters as base to our analysis.
  The motivation for this analysis was the fact that courses like Information Tecnology or Science and Tecnology have poor grades if compared with courses from the human area, so, we show this diferences trying to find patterns between the grades and number of enrollments in disciplines for both courses.
  In the end of this project, we want to know if there is a connection between the grades and the number of enrollments in disciplines by courses.
